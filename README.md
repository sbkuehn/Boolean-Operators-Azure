# Boolean Operators in Azure  
A collection of examples that show how boolean comparison operators drive cloud decisions across Python, PowerShell, Azure CLI, and Bicep.

This repo supports the blog post:  
**"Boolean Comparison Operators: The Tiny Truth Machines Running Your Entire Azure World"**

---

## Overview

Boolean comparison operators are the foundation of:
- Deployment gates  
- Azure Policy checks  
- Bicep conditional logic  
- Autoscaling behavior  
- FinOps anomaly detection  
- CI and CD workflows  
- Custom guardrails and automation  

This repo showcases small, clear examples of how boolean logic works inside real Azure scenarios.
